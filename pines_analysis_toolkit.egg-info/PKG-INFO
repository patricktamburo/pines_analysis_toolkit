        This is a package for working with PINES data.
        
        INSTALLATION
          1. Install git on your computer. 
          2. Create a directory where you want pines_analysis_toolkit to be installed. When writing new features for the toolkit, you will    do so in this directory.
          3. Navigate a terminal to that directory, and type the following: 
          
                git init
                
                git remote add origin https://github.com/patricktamburo/pines_analysis_toolkit.git
                
                git pull origin master
                
          4. Check to make sure files have appeared in the directory.
          5. Install the package locally by typing the following:
              python setup.py install
            OR
              python3 setup.py install
              ...whichever is the appropriate command for python 3 on your computer. 
          6. Check your Documents folder to see if the PINES_analysis_toolkit directory was created. All PINES data that you analyze will be placed here. 
          7. Start python, and type import pines_analysis_package. 
          8. If it imports without throwing any errors, you're done!
